	Great Question about "One Away"
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	One Away: There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character,
	remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are
	one edit (or zero edits) away.
	P.S.(the strings should be the same)
	EXAMPLES:
	pale, ple -> true
	pales, pale -> true
	pale, bale -> true
	pale, bake -> false
	pale, pxe -> false
	Hints:#23, #97, #130
