	Great Quesion about misspelled latters.

	----------------------------------------------

	Our input is an array with chars.
	ie:['a','b',c','d','t'...].

	Each time we encountered the latter 't' (or 'T') we need to look on it as an misspell latter,we need to convert it to 'x' (or 'X').

	We need to see all of our converted and unconverted Phrases.

	ie:
	input:  ['a','t','x','s','t']
	otuput: 1.['a','t','x','s','t']
			2.['a','x','x','s','t']
			3.['a','t','x','s','X']
			4.['a','X','x','s','X']

	Write the method(s) that have the an input array (of chars),and print out all the converted and unconverted Phrases.
	

	P.S.
	Let's assume to consider our input array as case insensitive.
